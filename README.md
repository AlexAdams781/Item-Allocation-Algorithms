# Item-Allocation-Algorithms
Implementations from algorithms found in various fair division papers

Algo_1.py, Algo_2.py, and Algo_3.py can be found in the paper "Fair Division with Two-Sided Preferences"
by Ayumi Igarashi, Yasushi Kawase, Warut Suksompong, Hanna Sumita (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05879)

EFM_Algorithm.py can be found in the paper "Envy-free Matchings in Bipartite Graphs and their Applications to Fair Division"
by Elad Aigner-Horev and Erel Segal-Halevi (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09527)

Gan_Algorithm.py can be found in the paper "Envy-freeness in house allocation problems"
by Jiarui Gan, Warut Suksompong, and Alexandros A. Voudouris (see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165489619300599)

Note, I particularly enjoyed writing the getMaxWeight function in Algo_1 (lines 38-54) because it involved
recursion and was the most algorithmically complex part of the code.
